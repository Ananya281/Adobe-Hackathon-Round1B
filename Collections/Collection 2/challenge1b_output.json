Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted.

When you open a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize Text tool to improve the output.

If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before attempting to edit the document.

When editing the document, ensure that the font and formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't have the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer . Remove security restrictions . If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove security from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF . Avoid editing complex elements . If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images, avoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. Check for compatibility issues . Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe Acrobat.

To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Reader extended PDF . Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating to Preferences > Security > Advanced Preferences > Verification tab.
